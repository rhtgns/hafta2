        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            William Shakespeare (1564-1616), English playwright, poet, and actor, is widely regarded as one of the
            greatest writers in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's
            national poet and the "Bard of Avon."
        </p>
        <p>
            His surviving works consist of around 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. His plays have
            been translated into every major language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
